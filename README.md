# Davidovits_E-mco152-2016_Project
The program my partner and I will be coding is a card game known as Aces up (a basic form of solitair). 
The goal of the card game is to discard all the cards and to be left with the four aces. 
Our program hopefully will evolve into clean advance code with many classes and data structures. 
As well we hope to include a GUI in our final stage!
